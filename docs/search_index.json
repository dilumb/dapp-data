[["index.html", "A Collection of DApp Event Logs Overview", " A Collection of DApp Event Logs Overview This is a repository of event logs of decentralized applications (DApps) deployed on public blockchain networks. The event logs contain historic information about events that occurred during the execution of the DApps. Currently, the collection contains logs for the following Ethereum-based DApps: Augur: a prediction and betting marketplace; Forsage: an investment application, which turns out to be a PONZI scheme; CryptoKitties: a game where virtual cats can be bred and traded as assets; and ChickenHunt: a game for hunting chickens. All event logs from this collection follow the IEEE XES standard and were extracted using the Ethereum Logging Framework (ELF). In addition to the event log data, this website provides a description of the data in the event logs, pointers to DApp documentations, links to ELF scripts used for data extraction, and insights obtained from a preliminary analyses for each DApp event log. This collection is part of our work on process mining for blockchain-based applications. Details can be found in the following publications: C. Klinkmüller, A. Ponomarev, A.B. Tran, I.

Augurs white paper characterizes the mechanics of a prediction and betting market: individuals can speculate on the outcomes of future events; those who forecast the outcome correctly win money, and those who forecast incorrectly lose money. As a betting market organized on Ethereum, the developers claim that Augur bypasses disadvantages of traditional betting markets, such as trusted market operator and limited participation. 1.1 Data Overview 1.1.1 Process Notion 1.1.2 Trace Attributes Attribute Type Description universe string description string extraInfo string type string minPrice int maxPrice int blockNumber int time:timestamp date 1.1.3 Event Attributes Attribute Type Description Event Classes 1.2 Preliminary Analysis "],["forsage.html", "2 Forsage 2.1 Data Overview 2.2 Preliminary Analysis", " 2 Forsage DApp Homepage: https://forsage.io DApp Source Code: available on etherscan.io ELF Script: Forsage.ethql Event Log: TODO 2.1 Data Overview Process Notion Trace Attributes Attribute Type Description concept:name xs:string the address of the user Event Attributes Event Class Description Register As User Reinvest Matrix-1 Reinvest Matrix-2 Upgrade Matrix-1 Upgrade Matrix-2 New User-Place Matrix-1 New User-Place Matrix-2 Missed Eth-Receive Matrix-1 Missed Eth-Receive Matrix-2 Received Extra Eth-Dividends Matrix-1 Recieved Extra Eth-Dividends Matrix-2 Attribute Type Description Event Classes 2.2 Preliminary Analysis "],["cryptokitties.html", "3 CryptoKitties 3.1 Data Overview 3.2 Preliminary Analysis", " 3 CryptoKitties DApp Homepage: https://www.cryptokitties.co DApp Source Code: available on etherscan.io ELF Script: CryptoKitties.ethql Event Log: TODO 3.1 Data Overview 3.1.1 Process Notion 3.1.2 Trace Attributes Attribute Type Description 3.1.3 Event Attributes Attribute Type Description Event Classes 3.2 Preliminary Analysis "],["chickenhunt.html", "4 ChickenHunt 4.1 Data Overview 4.2 Preliminary Analysis", " 4 ChickenHunt DApp Homepage: https://chickenhunt.io/ DApp Source Code: available on etherscan.io ELF Script: ChickenHunt.ethql Event Log: TODO 4.1 Data Overview 4.1.1 Process Notion 4.1.2 Trace Attributes Attribute Type Description 4.1.3 Event Attributes Attribute Type Description Event Classes 4.2 Preliminary Analysis "]]
