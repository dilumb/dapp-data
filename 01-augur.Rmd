Augur is a betting platform and prediction marketplace that is implemented as a set of smart contracts on the public Ethereum blockchain.
Augur’s white paper characterizes the mechanics of a prediction and betting market: “individuals can speculate on the outcomes of future events; those who forecast the outcome correctly win money, and those who forecast incorrectly lose
money.” As a betting market organized on Ethereum, the developers claim that Augur bypasses disadvantages of traditional betting markets, such as trusted market operator and limited participation.
