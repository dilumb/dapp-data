# Overview {-}

This is a repository of event logs of *decentralized applications* (DApps) deployed on public blockchain networks. 
The event logs contain historic information about events that occurred during the execution of the DApps.
Currently, the collection contains logs for the following Ethereum-based DApps:

- [Augur](#augur): a prediction and betting marketplace;
- [Forsage](#forsage): an investment application, which turns out to be a PONZI scheme;
- [CryptoKitties](#cryptokitties): a game where virtual cats can be bred and traded as assets; and
- [ChickenHunt](#chickenhunt): a game for hunting chickens.

All event logs from this collection follow the [IEEE XES standard](https://www.tf-pm.org/resources/xes-standard/about-xes) and were extracted using the [Ethereum Logging Framework](https://github.com/ChrisKlinkmueller/Ethereum-Logging-Framework/) (ELF).
In addition to the event log data, this website provides a description of the data in the event logs, pointers to DApp documentations, links to ELF scripts used for data extraction, and insights obtained from a preliminary analyses for each DApp event log.

This collection is part of our work on process mining for blockchain-based applications.
